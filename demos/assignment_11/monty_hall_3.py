"""
The second part of the ‚ÄúMonty Hall Problem‚Äù is the most interesting. After
selecting a door, but before the prize door is revealed, the contestant is
shown a losing door. The contestant now has the option of switching to the
other, as-yet unopened door. Should the contestant stick with their original
choice, switch to the other unopened door, or does it not matter?

Modify your program from Part 1 to always choose to switch to the other door
and display the winning percentage after a large number of simulation runs.
