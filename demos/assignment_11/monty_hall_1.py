"""
The ‚ÄúMonty Hall Problem‚Äù (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is
a classic introduction to game theory and probability simulations that comes
from a live TV game show in the 1960s. A contestant is faced with three doors.
Behind one door is a very large prize (say, a car). The contestant tries to
guess which door has the prize. We already know that mathematically the
contestant should win 33% of the time. Write a program that uses a Monte Carlo
simulation to prove it. For each simulation run, the program should use a
variable to represent the randomly chosen winning door number. The program
should then randomly select a door number from one to three to represent the
contestant‚Äôs choice. Finally, display the winning percentage after a large
number of simulation runs, and confirm that it is very close to 33%.
